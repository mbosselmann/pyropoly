    "Welcome to the world of Pyropoly, the timeless board game that combines strategy, luck, and finance, captivating players since the 1930s. As a first-time player, you're about to embark on an exciting journey of property trading, wealth accumulation, and shrewd negotiation.",
    "Pyropoly is played on a square board divided into 40 spaces, featuring properties, utilities, railroads, chance and community chest cards, luxury taxes, and four corner squares: GO, Jail, Free Parking, and Go to Jail. The objective is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting, and selling properties.",
    "Each player starts with a set amount of money. You roll two dice to move around the board, acquiring properties you land on, provided they're not already owned. You can buy houses and hotels on your properties to increase rent. When other players land on your properties, they pay you rent. The game's twist lies in its Chance and Community Chest cards, which can bring fortune or unexpected expenses.",
    "Negotiation is key. Trade properties with fellow players to create property sets and build your real estate empire. But beware of bankruptcy! If you can't pay your debts, youâ€™re out of the game.",
    "Remember, every game is a unique adventure. Strategy, luck, and interaction with other players make Pyropoly an endlessly entertaining experience.",
    "Good luck and enjoy the game!",

  rules: [
    "Start the game with each player selecting a token and receiving a standardized amount of money from the bank.",
    "Players take turns in a clockwise direction, starting with the player who rolls the highest number on the dice.",
    "On each turn, a player rolls two six-sided dice and moves their token forward the sum of the two dice.",
    "Landing on an unowned property allows the player to buy it from the bank at its printed price. If the player chooses not to buy, the property is auctioned off to the highest bidder.",
    "If a property is owned by another player, rent must be paid to that player according to the property's current value, which increases if the owner has a set or buildings on it.",
    "Completing a set of properties of the same color allows the player to build houses and hotels on those properties, increasing the rent owed by other players who land there.",
    "Landing on the 'Go to Jail' space, drawing certain 'Chance' or 'Community Chest' cards, or rolling doubles three times in a turn sends a player to jail. They cannot move until they roll doubles or pay a fine on subsequent turns.",
    "The 'Free Parking' space is just a free resting place; no reward or penalty is associated with landing here, contrary to popular house rules.",
    "Landing on the 'Income Tax' space requires the player to pay a fixed fee or a percentage of their total worth to the bank.",
    "Players can mortgage properties to the bank for money. Mortgaged properties cannot collect rent and must be unmortgaged before developing the property.",
    "Bankruptcy occurs when a player cannot pay what they owe. If it's to another player, all their assets are given to that player. If it's to the bank, their assets are auctioned off.",
    "Trading between players for money, properties, and 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards is allowed and encouraged.",
    "The game continues until all but one player have gone bankrupt. The last player remaining is declared the winner.",
    "Special events where properties go on 'fire sale' at discounted prices. Players must act quickly to seize these opportunities before they're gone.",
    "Heat Wave Taxes: Periodic 'heat wave taxes' where players must pay additional fees on their properties during certain rounds, simulating the challenges of managing properties in a scorching environment.",
    "Inferno Investments: Players can invest in fire-related businesses or properties that offer unique advantages, such as fire stations, factories, or renewable energy sources like solar panels.",
    "Fire Insurance: A mechanism where players can protect their properties from potential fire hazards. However, premiums may fluctuate based on the current state of the game board, requiring strategic decisions about risk management.",
    "Players can invest in upgrades for their properties, such as fire-resistant materials, emergency sprinkler systems, or advanced firefighting technology, to mitigate the risks of fire damage and enhance property values.",
    "Special tokens that players can use to influence the game in various ways, such as starting controlled burns to clear land for development, triggering firebreaks to protect their properties, or even igniting rival players' assets for strategic advantage.",
