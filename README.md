# ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ² Pyropoly: Reigniting Wealth in the Flames of Fortune (WIP) ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¥

Currently in development.

## Description

Pyropoly is a digital board game that combines the strategic gameplay of Monopoly with the fiery intensity of a pyromaniac's dream. Players compete to build their empires, but with a twist: they must navigate a dynamic and unpredictable environment of flames, heat, and burning ambition. Will you rise to the top, or will you be consumed by the flames?

## Name Origin

The name "Pyropoly" combines elements of "pyro," derived from the Greek word for fire ("pyr"), and "opoly," a suffix indicating a game resembling Monopoly. "Pyro" invokes the imagery of fire, heat, and energy, while "opoly" links it to the classic board game Monopoly, which is about property ownership and financial strategy.

## Game Mechanics

Will be added later.
